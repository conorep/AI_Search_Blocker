# AI_Search_Blocker
A small Chrome MV3 extension that removes Google's AI search result elements from Google searches in Chrome.

This is an EXTREMELY bare-bones extension that's ready to sideload in Chrome.\
I'll add further abilities in the future as I get annoyed by more forced web AI interactions.\
I'll also implement better logic so things like briefly seeing the Google search AI results elements right after 
page load will be better handled.
